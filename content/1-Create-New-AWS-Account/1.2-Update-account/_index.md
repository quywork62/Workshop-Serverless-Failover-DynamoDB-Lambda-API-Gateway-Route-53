#### 5. Finally we create the 2 records

First, create an A record for the root domain (symbol @), pointing to the server IP address provided by DataOnline. Then, continue to create another A record for the www prefix, also pointing to the same hosting IP. These two records will ensure that when users enter **turtleclouds.id.vn** or **www.turtleclouds.id.vn** in their browser, the system will correctly direct them to the website hosted on DataOnline.
