First, you need to register a domain on the tenten.vn website. After accessing the official website, search for the domain you desire, for example **turtleclouds.id.vn**. If this domain is still available, you can proceed with registration by filling in complete personal or business information, then making an online payment. Immediately after completion, the system will send you domain management information via email, allowing you full control over DNS records as well as Nameserver settings.
