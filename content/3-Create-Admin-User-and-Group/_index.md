In AWS, **IAM Role** is like a "permission set" that is predefined. A Role is not permanently attached to a specific user, but is temporarily "borrowed" by AWS services or applications to have permission to perform actions.

**Example:**

**AWS Lambda** needs a Role to have permission to read/write data to **DynamoDB**.

EC2 Instance can be assigned a Role to access S3 without storing Access Key/Secret Key in the machine.

Difference compared to IAM User:

User: attached to an individual or application, has username & password or access key.

Role: has no separate login information, only grants temporary permissions to services or users/applications that assume it.

ðŸ‘‰ In this lab, you will create a Role named **LambdaDynamoDBRole** to allow Lambda Functions to:

- Access DynamoDB.
- Write logs to CloudWatch.
